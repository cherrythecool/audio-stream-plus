# audiostreamplus

Support for more audio codecs while using AudioStream in Godot.

Currently this GDExtension adds:
- FLAC support
- Opus support
- Extended WAVE (as in, some codecs that Godot natively [doesn't support yet](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/96545)) and AIFF support

Please refer to [this tutorial](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/cpp/gdextension_cpp_example.html) for C++ GDExtension compilation instructions.

Tested to work on Godot 4.5.1 stable.
